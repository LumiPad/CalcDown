# Demo 4 — Agent Instructions

Scope: `demos/demo4/**`.

This folder is a small, static browser demo for the CalcDown parser/evaluator scaffold.

- Keep it dependency-light (no build tooling here; it loads `dist/` output).
- Prefer simple UI and clear rendering over feature completeness.
- `view` blocks accept JSON or YAML; prefer JSON for portability.
- Follow `demos/AGENTS.md`: use `installCalcdownStyles()` and avoid restyling CalcDown component primitives in demo CSS.
